## What about
libft extended includes the base libft (pretty much our own libc) where I added usefull functions and structures along my Jedai path towards the light of code.

## What's inside ?
* libc (ftc)
* Chained list(lst)
* Double chained list (dlst)
* Very little math function (math)
* Integer Sort algorithme (sort)
* printf
* get_next_line

## Compiling
Compiled on OSX with `make`.

## Disclaimer
Along my path I could have lost a few bugs. Let me know if you get them :-)
