## 🪧 Overview
This project is an introduction to the beautiful world of Raytracing.
Once completed you will be able to render simple Computer-Generated-Images and you
will never be afraid of implementing mathematical formulas again.

The goal of your program is to generate images using the Raytracing protocol. Those computer-generated images will each represent a scene, as seen from a specific angle and position, defined by simple geometric objects, and each with its own lighting system.
